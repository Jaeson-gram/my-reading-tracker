# my-reading-tracker
So I built a few classes to help me track my reading; How far I've gone with each book and how many of them I eventually complete.  
There are two libraries type: Books to read and books completed. 
Whenever I run the code I'll add the number of pages of any book I read each day, and when the number of pages read equals the book's 'pageCount', it is transfered to the books completed library.
This helps me track my reading. I want to finish 50 books by December, so when I 'booksCompleted.list()' the count should be 50 by December 31, 2024.

I'll get it up and running by March, but for now I'll add to this repo as many code as I add to it till it's ready. I want to redesign and redesign till it's cool enough to deploy-adding some more concepts as I keep on with Java.
Plus, from March, I'll be updating this repo prolly everyday, maybe only adding a comment showing the results of a books progress as I keep reading, or also making the code more beautiful, or functional. 
You might find my list of books interesting though.

Here is v.1.0
